\end{center}
In the course of Compilers, offered by CEFET-MG, we will build a compiler throughout the semester, this one, divided into stages. In the first step, we delivered the implementation of the lexical analyzer and the Symbol Table in Java. In this second stage, we are delivering the analysis of the program taking into account the language derivation. Such knowledge obtained with the discipline guided by Dr Kecia Ferreira, to make it possible, we use as a basis the concepts addressed by Aho, in his book: "Compilers Principles, Techniques and Tools "
